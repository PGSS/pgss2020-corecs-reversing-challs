For peeps who already know Python &amp; programming pretty well, I present some reversing challenges that will test the your lower bound on coding knowledge!

## Challenge difficulty

Intended difficulty curve is reversing_naught as easiest, then reversing_aleph, then reversing_aleph_prime. The flag is a single word and you should know it when you see it. I'm open to DM's on Discord for advice.
